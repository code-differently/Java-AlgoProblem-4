# Code Differently Message Encryptor

Students at Code Differently want to pass notes to one another. In case a note is confiscated 
by a staff member, the students decide to encrypt the messages. They do so by shifting each letter
in the `message` by a `shift`.

## Example 

### Input
Message: Kaleb
Shift 3

### Output
Ndohe

### Explanation
```
K => +3 => N
a -> +3 -> d
l -> +3 -> o
e -> +3 -> h
b -> +3 -> e
```
